## Tutorial
### the If statment
The if(...) statement evaluates a condition in parentheses and, if the result is true, executes a block of code.
```
    const prompt = require('prompt-sync')(); 
    // if this doesn't work then go back to js1_HelloWorld.md and follow setup steps 2-3
    
    let year = prompt('In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');
    if (year == 2015) console.log( 'You are right!' );
```
### the If statment code block 
if statments can trigger code blocks in curly braces
```
    if (year == 2015) {
    console.log( "That's correct!" );
    console.log( "You're so smart!" );
}
```
