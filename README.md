# What is MakerHub
Makerhub is a entity centered around project based learning of modern digital open source tools.
# Genetric Algorithem
Makerhub is currently focused on genetic algorithem study and application.  
# Problem type
Genetic Algorithems are well suited for problems that evaluation of a single solution is easy but finding the optimum solution among a large number of possible solutions is difficult.  some examples are Waze path-finding, non supervised clustering like image recognition cat or dog.
# Goals
### Makerhub short term goals are:
- master modern digital open source tools for digital development
- study and apply genetic algorithems for a selection of hard problems
- participate in GECCO 2023 conference (hopefully submit some papers)
- start up some specific applications of genetic algorithems and get external funding
### Makerhub long term goals are:
- effectivly document and pass digital knowlage 
- persue interesting projects that involve digital simulation
- solve hard problems using computers
